            <h1>Skyrim</h1>
            <p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following 2006's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011. It was an instant success, grossing 450 million dollars within the first week of release. The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel. Its main story focuses on the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely</p>

            <h2>Why I love Skyrim</h2>
            <p>When I first played Skyrim many years ago it completely changed my life. I had never really played any RPGs before this besides World of Warcraft, so this was really interesting to me. There are so many things to do, different paths to take, and so many places to explore. It has so much replayability and character variety. Will I ever stop being a stealth archer? Probably not. It has introduced me to so many other games as well, like Fallout, Diablo 3, and many more. It will always be in my top 3.</p>
