            <h1>Burnout 3</h1>
            <p>Burnout 3: Takedown is a 2004 racing video game developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts. It is the third instalment in the Burnout series, which is characterised by fast-paced arcade racing. A staple of the series is the use of boost, earned through risky driving, to rapidly increase a car's speed. The central mechanic introduced in Burnout 3 is Takedowns, which allow players to slam their opponents until they crash. Takedowns work in conjunction with the boost system by filling up and extending the boost meter. Aside from standard circuit races, the game features modes focused on performing Takedowns on rival vehicles and causing monetary damage at a junction occupied with traffic. Each game variant is featured in a single-player campaign mode called World Tour, which serves as the primary method for unlocking new and faster cars. The game supports both online and split-screen multiplayer</p>

            <h2>Why I love Burnout</h2>
            <p>I really like cars, so racing games were always fun for me to play. Unlike Gran Turismo, Burnout was different because it was more than just racing, it had so many fun objectives and crashing was very much encouraged. For me it changed the car game genre. Plus the Burnout games have phenomenal soundtracks, specifically Takedown and Legends, it helped shape my music taste. Burnout 3: Takedown and Burnout Legends will forever hold a special place in my heart.</p>
