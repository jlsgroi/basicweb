            <h1>Luigi's Mansion</h1>
            <p>Luigi's Mansion is a 2001 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo. The game was a launch title for the GameCube and was the first game in the Mario franchise to be released for the console; it was released in North America on November 18, 2001. Players control Luigi as he explores a haunted mansion, searches for Mario and deals with ghosts by capturing them through a vacuum cleaner supplied by Professor E. Gadd. Luigi's Mansion received a positive critical reception overall, with reviewers praising the gameplay, setting, and soundtrack, though its short length was criticized. The game has sold over 3.3 million copies, and is the fifth-best-selling GameCube game of all time. It was one of the first games to be re-released as a Player's Choice title on the system, and achieved a cult following. The game was followed by two sequels Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and Luigi's Mansion 3, which was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2019.</p>

            <h2>What I love Luigi's Mansion</h2>
            <p>Luigi's Mansion was probably one of the earliest games I remember playing and watching my older siblings play. I love spooky stuff but not horror games and this captures the right amount of spooky and mystery with everything you love about a Nintendo game. I love exploring the mansion and catching ghosts with the phenomenal soundtrack playing in the background, the song that plays in E. Gadd's lab with always be my favorite. When it comes to the other games in the series, I did not care for Dark Moon that much, but Luigi's Mansion 3 really expanded upon everything I loved about the first game, brought in new lovable characters, and gave an abundence of floors to explore throughout the hotel. If you have the opportunity to play either the first or third game, I highly recommend it!</p>
